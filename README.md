# Object-Detection-for-Images-Videos-and-Real-Time-Camera-Feed

Comparison between 3 major image processing algorithms: Single Shot Detection (SSD),RetinaNet and YOLOv3 was done to find the fastest and most efficient of the three. Using the Microsoft COCO dataset and kaggle, they were evaluated by the basis of their detection accuracy on images, videos and on real
time camera feed.

##Dataset used is MSCOCO files.
